# xfce4-terminal-colors-smyck

[SMYCK](http://color.smyck.org) color scheme for Xfce4 Terminal application.

# Installation

Place `smyck.theme` where all the other themes are located. It depends on your system.

For Ubuntu 13.04 place it to `/usr/share/xfce4/terminal/colorschemes/` because it doesn't support yet theme lookup in user directory.
